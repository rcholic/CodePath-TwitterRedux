# Project 4 - *Enhanced Twitter Redux App*

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Hamburger menu
   - [x] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [x] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [x] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [x] Profile page
   - [x] Contains the user header view
   - [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline
   - [x] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Profile Page
   - [x] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1. Button animations such as popping effect when user taps on the **Favorite** button for a tweet
  2. Add elastic effect when closing the side menu
  3. Cast a backdrop to dim the content view when the side menu slides out, this will help user to focus on the menu visually

## Notes

Time was the most precious commodity in this week, so I feel rushed when implementing/building off my Week 3 App for this assignment. If I had more time, I believe I could have put in more efforts to make the UI look greater!
